## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** to reduce file size without losing quality
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
   
2. **Use WebP format** for better compression (optional)
   - Convert JPG/PNG to WebP for ~30% smaller files
   
3. **Provide alt text** in code for accessibility

4. **Use descriptive filenames**
   - Good: `vantara-datacenter-infrastructure.jpg`
   - Bad: `IMG_1234.jpg`
